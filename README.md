Matlab Toolbox to solve the EEG inverse problem.
It has some basic functions that can be useful to those that are new to the topic.
This is more like a "personal" repo, but if you find something useful, feel free to used it for whatever you want.
To install it just add it to your matlab tab and add the required toolboxes in the 'external/' directory.
